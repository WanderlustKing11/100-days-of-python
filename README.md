## 100 Days of Python ##

Hi, my name is Doug, and I'm here to learn python.

Years ago I started learning JavaScript, and have a background as a full stack developer. And I owe all of that to Dr. Angela Yu and her Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. To this day, it is still my favorite tutorial/bootcamp course of all time.

This repo is my journey following along Dr. Angela Yu's new Python Bootcamp, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy.

I cannot make the pledge that this will be updated everyday, but I will try to put my own creative spin on what I'm taught here, and will do my best to show my work and how the projects were built.

Feel free to do with it as you please. And hope you enjoy

In my local environment, I'm using VS Code with the Python extension, and I made sure to install python onto my machine. That's it.
