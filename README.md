## 100 Days of Python ##

Hi, my name is Doug, and I'm here to learn python.

Years ago I started learning JavaScript, and have a background as a full stack developer. And I owe all of that to Dr. Angela Yu and her Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. To this day, it is still my favorite tutorial/bootcamp course of all time.

This repo is my journey following along Dr. Angela Yu's new Python Bootcamp, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" on Udemy.

I cannot make the pledge that this will be updated everyday, but I will try to put my own creative spin on what I'm taught here, and will do my best to show my work and how the projects were built.

I will make an attempt to add some extra projects and some creative code that is based around the lessons, but with my own spin on the topic.

The course comes with exercises and quizes. I show most of the work for the exercises as they help understand the fundamentals of a topic. But I will not be showing any of the quizes.

Feel free to do with it as you please. And hope you enjoy!

In my local environment, I'm using VS Code with the Python extension, and I made sure to install python onto my machine. That's it.

The course will suggest, around Day 15, to install PyCharm. In the meantime, the course allows the students to follow along and code using Replit and forking the course material. Replit allows us to code in a browser without needing to install Python or an IDE. I am just going to continue with Github for now and code it on my own, using my own work environment for my own enjoyment.
